                <li><h3>Regulatory Background</h3>
                <h4>2.1 Privacy and Related Legislation</h4>
                <p>The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) sets out the requirements that Trackon must use to collect, use or disclose personal information in the course of its commercial activities, including information about employees1. In addition, some provinces have privacy laws and have additional requirements that must be followed.</p>
                <p>Additional legislation, that has privacy related components, that set out other requirements that Trackon must comply with is Canada’s Anti-Spam legislation (CASL). The requirements in these pieces of legislation guide the way we can electronically market to potential customers and how we communicate with our existing customers.</p>
                <h4><strong>2.2 The Regulators</strong></h4>
                <p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (OPC), also referred to as the Privacy commissioner, oversees compliance with PIPEDA. Their mission is to protect and promote the privacy rights of individuals which is done by:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Investigating complaints;</li>
                <li>Conducting audits and pursuing court action under federal privacy law;</li>
                <li>Publicly reporting on the personal information handling practices of public and private sector organizations;</li>
                <li>Supporting, undertaking and publishing research into privacy issues; and</li>
                <li>Promoting public awareness and understanding of privacy issues.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The OPC is also tasked with investigating violations related to CASL, in particular,</p>
                 <ul>
                     <li>The harvesting of electronic addresses, in which email list are compiled through the use of computer programs to automatically mine the Internet for email addresses; and,</li>

                 </ul>
                <p>Each province and territory in Canada has a commissioner or ombudsman responsible for overseeing provincial and territorial privacy legislation. In most cases, these individuals or bodies defer to the OPC.</p>
                <p>The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) has been tasked with overseeing compliance with CASL. They are responsible for investigating the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messages, unsolicited telecommunications and the installation of software without consent.</p>
                <h4><strong>2.3 Regulator Audits</strong></h4>
                <p>The OPC conducts audits to ensure companies are sufficiently managing personal information in its possession. These audits may look at the physical and security controls in place, what policies and procedures exist, and how the organization manages privacy issues. Through these reviews, the OPC can identify areas for improvement which may result in public disclosure or compliance agreements.</p>
                <p>The OPC has the power to receive, initiate, investigate and attempt to resolve complaints about any aspect of Trackon’ s compliance with PIPEDA provisions.</p>
                <p>The CRTC has the power to receive, initiate, investigate and attempt to resolve complaints about any aspect of Trackon’s compliance with CASL provisions under which they can leave decisions, notices and orders in respect to non-compliance.</p>

Any staff managing initiatives involving personal information must notify the Privacy Officer that a PIA is required, and work with the Privacy Officer to complete the PIA. In order to avoid delays, sufficient time must be allotted in project plans to allow for the completion of a PIA, as well as any risk mitigation implications deemed necessary. These must be completed prior to the “go live” date of new projects and/or processes.</p>
                <p>Staff that are uncertain as to whether or not a project or process change under their management has a privacy or PI related component that requires the completion of a PIA should contact the Privacy Officer.</p>
                </li>

                <li><h3>Breach Response Plan (Mandatory Breach Notification)</h3>
                <p>In the event Trackon suspects or has a breach of security safeguards, which is the loss of, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of, personal information under our control and if it is reasonable to believe the breach creates a real risk of significant harm, the breach must be reported to the Privacy Commissioner, regardless of how the potential breach was detected..</p>
                <p>The following are the steps we must take when we believe there is such a breach.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Determine if there is a “real risk of significant harm” (RROSH);</li>
                    <li>Report the breach;</li>
                    <li>Notification; and</li>
                    <li>Record keeping.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>6.1 Determine if there is a “Real Risk of Significant Harm”</strong></h4>
                <p>To determine if the breach poses a RROSH to any individual whose personal information was involved in the breach we must conduct a risk assessment. The following factors are some of the considerations that we must include in assessing the risks taken from OPC guidance4:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sensitivity of the personal information involved i.e. How sensitive is the information? Was the personal information adequately encrypted, anonymized or otherwise not easily accessible?</li>
                    <li>Probability of Misuse. i.e. What happened and how likely is it that someone would be harmed by the breach? Who actually accessed or could have accessed the personal information? How long has the personal information been exposed?</li>
                    <li>The cause and extent of the breach i.e. Is there a risk of ongoing breaches or further exposure of the information – is it a systemic issue? Has the personal information been recovered?</li>
                    <li>The individuals affected by the breach i.e. How many individuals’ personal information was involved? Who is affected by the breach: employees, customers, etc.?</li>
                </ul>
                <h4><strong>6.2 Reporting the Breach</strong></h4>
                <p>We must notify the privacy commissioner, of any breach of security safeguards involving personal information under its control if it is reasonable to believe the breach creates a real risk of significant harm as determined in the step above. The report should contain the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A description of the circumstances of the breach and, if known, the cause;</li>
                    <li>The day or the period in which the breach occurred;</li>
                    <li>A description of the personal information that was involved in the breach;</li>
                    <li>an estimate of the number of individuals impacted – where the breach creates a real risk of significant harm;</li>
                    <li>The steps that the organization has taken to reduce the risk of harm to the impacted individuals;</li>
                    <li>The steps that the organization has taken or will take to notify impacted individuals; and</li>
                    <li>The name and contact information of a person who can answer, on behalf of the organization, the Privacy Commissioner’s questions about the breach.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The OPC has published a reporting form the should be used for reporting breaches which can be accessed here:</p>
                <p className='privacyi-pdf'>https://www.priv.gc.ca/media/4844/pipeda_pb_form_e.pdf</p>

                <h4><strong>6.4 Record Keeping</strong></h4>
                <p>We must notify affected individuals if it is determined that there is a RROSH. How the notification will take place depends on serval factors such as if contact information of the impacted individuals is known, cost, and if the method chosen to deliver such a notification will cause further harm.</p>
                <p>Issuing notification that contains:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A description of the circumstances of the breach;</li>
                    <li>The day or period during which the breach occurred;</li>
                    <li>A description of the personal information that was involved in the breach;</li>
                    <li>the steps that the organization has taken to reduce the risk of harm to the impacted individuals;</li>
                    <li>The steps that the impacted individuals could take to reduce the risk of harm resulting from the breach;</li>
                    <li>A toll-free number or email address that the impacted individuals can use to obtain further information about the breach; and</li>
                    <li>Information about the organization’s internal complaint process and about the individual’s right, under PIPEDA and that they can make a complaint with the privacy commissioner.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We must also notify other organizations or government institution if we believe they may be able to reduce the risk of harm to the impacted individuals. (i.e. law enforcement agencies). If this is the case, consent of individuals is not required for such disclosures.</p>
                <h4><strong>6.4 Record Keeping</strong></h4>
                <p>Organizations are required to keep and maintain records of all breaches of security safeguards, including those that do not meet the harm threshold for reporting and notification. These records must be provided to the privacy commissioner upon request. Records must be maintained for 24 months from the day that the organization determined that the breach occurred, and that they contain sufficient information to enable the privacy commissioner to verify compliance with the breach reporting obligations.</p>
                </li>
